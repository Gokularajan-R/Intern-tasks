        "# File Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "File handling in Python allows you to create, read, write, and delete files. Python provides several built-in functions to handle files, such as `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `open()` function is used to open a file, which returns a file object. You can specify the mode to open the file, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `'r'`: Read mode (default)\n",
        "- `'w'`: Write mode (creates a new file if it does not exist)\n",
        "- `'a'`: Append mode (adds content to the end of the file)\n",
        "- `'b'`: Binary mode (e.g., images)\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Writing to a file\n",
        "with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
        "    file.write('Hello, world!')\n",

        "# Reading from a file\n",
        "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
        "    content = file.read()\n",
        "    print(content)\n",
        "```\n",
        "The `with` statement is used to handle the file without the need to explicitly call `close()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Questions:\n",
        "1. How do you open a file in write mode?\n",
        "2. What is the purpose of the `'b'` mode?\n",
        "3. What is the difference between `'w'` and `'a'` modes?\n",
        "4. How can you read the entire contents of a file?\n",
        "5. What does the `with` statement do in file handling?\n",
        "6. Write a Python program to create a text file named sample.txt, write a few lines to it, and then read and display the contents.\n",
        "8. Write a program that counts the number of words in a file provided by the user.\n",
